## Description of The Task, of this Repository
This task is to help familiarise myself with React Native and Expo CLI.

Focusing mainly on the App.js file, as the entry point of this mobile application created with a blank template, I made a few changes:
1. I changed the background color of the View component from white to lavendar.
2. I replaced the original text in the Text component with 'My name is Naa Shidaa'.
3. I introduced the font size style into the Text component to increase the font size of the text to 24.
4. Lastly, I made my name in the new text 'bold' by introducing the font Weight style into the Text component.

The commits to this repository were made in the order of completion of the task.
